        Rural Development is a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving the quality of life in Sri Lanka’s rural areas. It encompasses infrastructure upgrades, agricultural modernization, access to education and healthcare, and the creation of sustainable livelihoods. The program addresses regional disparities by investing in roads, water supply, schools, and community centers. It also supports entrepreneurship and skill development, enabling rural populations to participate fully in the national economy. Rooted in equity and sustainability, Rural Development is a long-term commitment to uplifting the heart of the nation — its villages and their people.
